# SCRAMBLE - FACE REDACTION
Based on the "SCRAMBLE Goggles" technology in the **SCP Foundation** fictional lore; this is a real working version of the SCRAMBLE system that can redact all faces.

I am currently using: **Mediapipe** and **OpenCV** for this project; I was originally using the built-in face detection in **opencv-python** however I plan to deploy this project on an embedded system and **mediapipe** seemed more effective for the job. 

Open to any issues / ideas / contributions 

_Please note: this project is made under python3.12x and will not work on 3.13x due to mediapipe not supporting 3.13x yet_

**Current Project status: SCRAMBLE has been made; but I do want to add a text feature beside it, then I want to further push this to my embedded system which will require me to optimize this.**
